**[Option 2] Diagnostic Analytics**
Diagnostic analytics focuses on determining the cause of an event or outcome. It digs deeper into the data to analyze the relationship between cause and effect in order to answer the question, "Why did this happen?" Diagnostic analytics uses correlations, pattern recognition, and data mining techniques within the data to track down the cause. For example, it might include analyzing why sales suddenly dropped, or determining how a particular marketing campaign affected consumer behavior.

Key Features:

- Historical Data Examination for Root Causes: Emphasize the investigation and analysis of historical data to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies that explain why certain events occurred. This involves identifying the underlying factors and reasons behind specific outcomes.

**[Option 3] Predictive Analytics**

Predictive analytics aims at forecasting future events or outcomes by analyzing patterns in historical and current data. It utilizes a wide array of techniques from statistics, machine learning, and data mining to predict the likelihood of future results, behaviors, and trends. This approach not only relies on the examination of past and present data but also employs modeling to anticipate future scenarios. For instance, predictive analytics can be used to forecast customer churn, predict machinery failures before they occur, or estimate future sales trends. By understanding probable future events, organizations can make informed decisions to proactively manage potential opportunities and risks.

Key Features:

- Data Analysis for Future Predictions: Emphasize the utilization of current and historical data to predict future events or outcomes. This involves applying statistical, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques to analyze patterns and trends.
